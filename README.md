# INESCTEC-Summer-Internship

On this internship I studied the influence of the training dataset's face diversity on the performance of a face classifier. I also investigated how to minimize the resources utilized when training the classifier, while maintaining its performance. In order to do this, I had to study a lot of machine learning, mainly facial recognition algorithms and what architectures can be used.
The data analysis, training and testing of the various classifiers developed were done using mostly Python and some libraries like OpenCV and Keras.
